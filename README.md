<h3>Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin</h3>

<h2>Overview of Repsitory</h2>
This repository contains all the essentials pertaining to the Machine Learning and Statistics module for 2022, as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics. 
Inside the 'Practicals' folder, we have three ntoebooks containing completed exercises. There is also a Jupyter Notebook entitled '05-evalutayion.ipynb' that covers the Keras Timeseries Anomaly Detection workflow. 


<h2>Running the Notebooks</h2>
View the Keras Timeseries Anomaly Notebook with NBViewer and Binder. It is advisable to view the notebook using the following formats as GitHub can have issues displaying notebooks as originally intended. 


Static Version: &nbsp;[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/conor-mccaffrey/machstat-assessment/blob/main/05-evaluation.ipynb)


Dynamic Version: &nbsp;[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/conor-mccaffrey/machstat-assessment/HEAD)

<h2>Practical Exercises</h2>
This folder contains three notebooks, 01-statistics-exercises.ipynb, 02-models.ipynb and 03-Parameters_Exercises.ipynb detailing excercises that were carried out over the course of the semester. These exercises gave us the grounding necessery to be able to work through the Keras notebook.

<h2>Evaluation of Keras Timeseries Anomaly Notebook</h2>
This notebook covers the project part of our module. It is a walkthrough of the Keras Timeseries Anomaly Detection notebook (found at the following link: https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/), with some improvements made by us. This notebook is evidence of the knowledge gained throughout the duration of the module.
